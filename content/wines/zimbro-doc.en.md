Douro in it's full power! This thick inky tinto made of the local Touriga Nacional, Tinta Roriz and Touriga Francesa ranks among the top 7% of the best wines in the world (according to vivino.com) is a great example of this region's exceptional wines. And this family run vineyard is pure winemaker art, that you should definitely know about. Enjoy it best with friends and a nice plate of pasta, red meat or your favourite cheese.
